This project involves scripting languages; Bash and Perl, we used these languages to sort and search through a file containing 50 words each written on a new line. I utilized functions that exist within the languages along with conditional conditions and loops, the zip contains three files the first being a shell script that contains a menu that asks you if you want to sort your file containing 50 words through perl or shell and another option is to search for word in file. 

The zip file contains a shell script called Lab3.sh, a perl script called perlsort.pl that sorts the file alphabetically along with outputting it into a file that you name , a shell script called shellsort.sh that sorts the file alphabetically along with outputting it into a file that you name and a perl script that searches for a word and than prints if it's in the file along with the line it's on. The words file contains 50 words each on a new line to test Lab3.sh functionality along with the file empty that contains nothing to do the same.
